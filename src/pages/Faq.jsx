                An NFT game combines conventional gaming designs with
                unconventional game mechanisms to let users have more control
                over in-game assets like virtual mines, characters, items and
                much more. This is made possible by launching games on
                blockchains and anchoring them with digital asset-powered
                economies. These digital assets are often NFTs so that they are
                distinguishable and tamper-proof. The adoption of NFT token
                standards also allows developers to preserve the rarity and
                uniqueness of some of these in-game items.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                With this system in place, the players can claim ownership of
                game assets through 3 main strategies. They can mint new
                characters, purchase digital items on native or third-party
                marketplaces, or unlock and earn new items. Whichever way you
                choose to access these game assets, you have exclusive ownership
                rights over them. In essence, you can distribute or sell them
                and pocket all the money made from such trades. This is why this
                gaming model is called play-to-earn.
